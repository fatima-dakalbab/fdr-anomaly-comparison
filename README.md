# FDR Anomaly Comparison

This repository contains a reproducible experimental framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection on Flight Data Recorder (FDR) time-series data.

## Features
- Window-based anomaly detection
- Synthetic anomaly injection
- Comparative evaluation of unsupervised models

## Structure
- `src/` – core pipeline (preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)
- `experiments/` – runnable experiment scripts
- `results/` – generated outputs (not tracked)

## Status
Work in progress – experiments ongoing.
